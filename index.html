<p class="background text floating">According to Freud's model of the psyche, the id is the primitive and instinctual part of the mind that contains sexual and aggressive drives and hidden memories, the super-ego operates as a moral conscience, and the ego is the realistic part that mediates between the desires of the id and the super-ego.
Although each part of the personality comprises unique features, they interact to form a whole, and each part makes a relative contribution to an individual's behavior.</p>
<p>I believe in Roland Barthe’s theory of The Death of the Author. I believe people should not tried to figure the “right” answer of every artwork. At lease for my art, I want people to think more about themselves while looking at my works. I want people to combine their own experience with the stories I convey, to figure out their own stories in their own ways, and to think about the deeper meanings. Just like the saying “there are a thousand Hamlets in a thousand people's eyes,” people can never get the exact same feelings while looking at art. Becoming a successful storyteller is one of my goal, but at the same time, I want to be able to tell multiple stories through my work. I do not want people to only get a single story while seeing my work. I wish people can feel something after “reading” my story. </p>
